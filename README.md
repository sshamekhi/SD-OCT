# SD-OCT
Spectral-domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) is one of the main imaging methods in the diagnosis of retinal diseases such as diabetic macular degeneration (DME) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). One of the methods that physicians use to diagnose the diseases mentioned above is to check the layers of retinal tissue in SD-OCT images visually. Therefore, for automatic SD-OCT image classification, in this work, an algorithm consisting of four stages of preprocessing, layer border extraction, feature extraction, and image classification was proposed.
